# Interview Platform

A two-service application for running AI-assisted interview sessions. It is provided as a single repository so the whole thing clones, runs, and releases as one unit.

```
.
├── api/    # Backend service (Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis/Sidekiq)
└── web/    # Frontend web app (React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind)
```

The two services run together: the web app talks to the API over REST and WebSocket.

## Running it locally

Each service has its own setup guide. Run the API first, then the web app pointed at it.

1. **API** — see [`api/README.md`](api/README.md). Rails app; needs Ruby (see `api/.ruby-version`), PostgreSQL, and Redis. It serves on `http://localhost:3001`.
2. **Web** — see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md). Vite app; `npm install`, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at the API, then `npm run dev`. It serves on `http://localhost:5173`.
